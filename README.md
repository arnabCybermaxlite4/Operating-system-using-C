# ⚙️ Operating System Algorithms in C

Welcome to the ultimate collection of **Operating System (OS) scheduling** and **memory allocation algorithms** implemented in **C**. This repository is designed to help students, developers, and enthusiasts understand and simulate key OS concepts with clean, modular code.

---

## ✅ CPU Scheduling Algorithms

🔹 **FCFS** – First Come First Serve  
🔹 **SJF** – Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)  
🔹 **Priority Scheduling** (Non-Preemptive & Preemptive)  
🔹 **Round Robin**

## 🧠 Memory Allocation Algorithms

🔸 **First Fit**  
🔸 **Best Fit**  
🔸 **Worst Fit**

---

## 📚 Why This Repo?

✨ **Clean and modular C code**  
✨ **Well-commented** for better understanding  
✨ Suitable for **lab assignments**, **college projects**, or **self-study**  
✨ Includes **sample outputs** for reference

HOW TO RUN-----
---
1.Navigate to the desired program folder:
bash
cd CPU_Scheduling   # or Memory_Allocation

2.Compile the C file using GCC:
bash
gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs
powershell
gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs.exe

3.Run the compiled program:
bash
./fcfs     # On Linux/Mac
fcfs.exe   # On Windows (or just `fcfs` if using PowerShell)
powershell
.\fcfs.exe
